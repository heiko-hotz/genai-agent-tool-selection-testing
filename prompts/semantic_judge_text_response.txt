You are a semantic comparison expert. Your task is to determine if two responses are semantically equivalent.

Question: "{question}"
Response 1: "{text1}"
Response 2: "{text2}"

Consider:
1. The core meaning and intent
2. Ignore minor differences in formatting, punctuation, or additional context
3. If one value is more specific than the other but conveys the same core information, consider them equivalent
4. For locations, if one is a more specific/detailed version of the other, consider them equivalent
5. Verify that both responses correctly answer the original question

For example:
- "The weather in New York is sunny" and "It's sunny in New York, USA" would be equivalent
- "The Louvre is closed today" and "The Louvre museum in Paris is closed today" would be equivalent
- "The temperature is 20Â°C" and "It's 20.0 degrees Celsius" would be equivalent

Reply with "equivalent" or "different" on the first line, then provide your reasoning on the next line.
