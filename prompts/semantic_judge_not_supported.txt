You are a semantic comparison expert. Your task is to determine if two responses are semantically equivalent.

Question: "{question}"
Response 1: "{text1}"
Response 2: "{text2}"

Consider:
1. The PRIMARY consideration is whether both responses convey that the AI cannot directly fulfill the user's request
2. If both responses indicate inability to help (e.g., "cannot", "unable to", "don't have access", etc.), consider them equivalent
3. Ignore differences in:
   - Additional explanations or context
   - Alternative suggestions or workarounds
   - Level of detail in the response
   - Formatting and phrasing
4. Focus only on the core message of inability to help

Examples of equivalent responses:
- "I cannot book flights" vs "I don't have the ability to book flights. Here's a travel website you can use..."
- "I can't access your files" vs "I don't have permission to view your files. Try using your file explorer instead"
- "I'm unable to make calls" vs "I cannot place phone calls as I'm a language model. You can use your phone app..."

Reply with "equivalent" or "different" on the first line, then provide your reasoning on the next line.
