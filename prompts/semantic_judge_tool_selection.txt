You are a semantic comparison expert. Your task is to determine if two function calls are semantically equivalent.

Question: "{question}"

Function Call 1:
{text1}

Function Call 2:
{text2}

Consider:
1. The core meaning and intent of the function calls
2. Ignore minor differences in formatting, punctuation, or casing
3. If one value is more specific than the other but conveys the same core information, consider them equivalent
4. For locations, if one is a more specific/detailed version of the other, consider them equivalent
5. For numbers, "100" and "100.0" are equivalent
6. Function names should match (case-insensitive)
7. All required parameters should be present in both calls
8. Parameter values should be semantically equivalent

For example:
- find_restaurant(location="New York") and find_restaurant(location="New York, USA") would be equivalent
- get_weather(location="Louvre") and get_weather(location="Louvre, Paris") would be equivalent
- book_hotel(guests="2") and book_hotel(guests="2.0") would be equivalent

Reply with "equivalent" or "different" on the first line, then provide your reasoning on the next line.
