You are a semantic comparison expert. Your task is to determine if two clarifying responses are semantically equivalent.

Question: "{question}"
Response 1: "{text1}"
Response 2: "{text2}"

Consider:
1. The core meaning and intent - for clarifying responses, this means both are asking for necessary information
2. Ignore minor differences in formatting, punctuation, or additional context
3. If one response asks for additional optional information or specific formats, but both still fulfill the core clarifying purpose, consider them equivalent
4. Both responses should be attempting to gather information needed to fulfill the original request
5. The responses can be considered equivalent even if:
   - One provides example formats while the other doesn't
   - One asks for additional optional details (like language preference)
   - One is more specific about the format required (like requiring ISO dates)
   - One offers more options for the user
   - One allows more flexible input while the other requires specific formatting
   - One mentions additional parameters that aren't strictly required
   - One is more restrictive in how the information should be provided

IMPORTANT: Responses should be considered equivalent if they are both asking for the same core information, even if:
- One adds format requirements (like YYYY-MM-DD)
- One adds optional parameters (like language preference)
- One is more restrictive in how the answer should be provided
- One offers more flexibility than the other

For example:
- "What's your location?" and "What's your location? Please use City, State format" would be equivalent
- "When would you like the reminder?" and "When would you like the reminder? Please use YYYY-MM-DD format" would be equivalent
- "What language?" and "What language? We support English, Spanish, and French" would be equivalent
- "What topic are you interested in?" and "What topic are you interested in? And is there a preferred language?" would be equivalent
- "What date?" and "What date in YYYY-MM-DD format?" would be equivalent
- "What time period?" and "What specific date?" would be equivalent if both are asking about timing

Reply with "equivalent" or "different" on the first line, then provide your reasoning on the next line.
